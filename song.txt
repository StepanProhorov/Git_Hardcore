We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell

I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground(leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again
It's a final countdown

The final countdown

We're heading for Venus
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all

With so many light years to go
And thing to be found
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown

The final countdown

It's the final countdown

We're leaving together

The final countdown

We'll all miss her so

It's the final countdown
