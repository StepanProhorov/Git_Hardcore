We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell

I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground(leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again
It's a final countdown

The final countdown

We're heading for Venus
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all
